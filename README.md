# TIC-TAC-TOE


Tic Tac Toe is a classic game played on a 3x3 grid, where two players take turns marking X and O symbols.
The objective of Tic Tac Toe is to get three of your symbols (X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
The game starts with an empty grid, and players alternate turns, placing their symbols in vacant cells.
Players must strategize to block their opponent's moves while also aiming to create a winning combination themselves.
The game can end in three ways: a player wins, the game ends in a tie (if the entire grid is filled without a winner), or the game is abandoned.
Tic Tac Toe is a game of skill and foresight, requiring players to anticipate their opponent's moves and plan their own accordingly.
It is a popular game played by people of all ages, from children to adults, due to its simplicity and entertainment value.
Tic Tac Toe is often used as a teaching tool to introduce concepts of logic and strategic thinking.
The game has inspired various adaptations and variations, including larger grids, different symbols, and additional dimensions.
Tic Tac Toe can be played in person using pen and paper, or through digital platforms, providing a convenient way to enjoy the game anytime, anywhere.
